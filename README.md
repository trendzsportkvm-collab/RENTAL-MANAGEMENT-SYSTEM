# Trendz Admin Panel

Trendz Rental Management Frontend

Build a complete Rental Management Web App for a premium clothing rental store called "Trendz" based in Kerala, India. This is a private admin panel used only by shop staff — not a public-facing customer site.

Design Direction

Theme: Dark mode, ultra-premium, minimal. Think Notion meets Linear meets a luxury fashion brand.

Color Palette: Deep charcoal background (#0F0F0F or #111318), rich cream/ivory text, one accent color — warm gold (#C9A84C) for highlights and CTAs. Muted rust (#A0522D) for warnings/overdue. Emerald green (#2E7D52) for paid/success states.

Typography: Use "Fraunces" (serif) for headings and logo. "Inter" for all body text and data. "IBM Plex Mono" for tokens, SKUs, amounts. Import from Google Fonts.

Style Rules: Glassmorphism cards with backdrop-filter: blur. Thin 1px borders with low-opacity white. Smooth transitions on all hover states. No harsh shadows — use subtle glows instead. Rounded corners (12px cards, 8px buttons, 6px inputs).

Sidebar: Fixed left sidebar, 240px wide, dark (#0A0A0F), with the Trendz logo at the top. Nav items have an active state with a gold left-border indicator and slight background highlight.

Tables: Clean, borderless rows. Alternating very subtle row shading. Sticky header. Each row has smooth hover highlight.

App Structure — Pages & Navigation

Use a fixed left sidebar with these navigation items (with appropriate icons):

Scan & Lookup (icon: search/barcode)

All Products (icon: grid)

Rentals Dashboard (icon: clipboard-list)

Financial Ledger (icon: chart-bar)

CSV Import (icon: upload)

No routing needed — use tab/page switching with React state.

State Management Notes (for Lovable)

Use React state (useState/useReducer) for everything — no backend needed yet.

products[] — list of all products with branch stock

rentals[] — list of all rentals (active and returned)

activePage — current tab/page

When a rental is created:

Add to rentals[]

Deduct quantity from the matching product's branch stock

When a rental is marked returned:

Update rental status to "returned", payment_status to "paid"

Add quantity back to product branch stock
